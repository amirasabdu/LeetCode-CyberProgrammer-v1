#  LeetCode - Cyber-Programmer - 10 Coding Problems v1

LeetCode primarily focuses on general data structures and algorithms, but certain questions can be more relevant to cybersecurity by emphasizing areas like cryptography, secure data handling, and system security concepts.
###
Here are 10 LeetCode problems that could be particularly relevant for someone interested in cybersecurity, touching on concepts that are often used or paralleled in the field. This is the first volume in a series. For solutions and detailed explanations for each problem, follow the link provided.

|   | Problem | Description |
|------|------|------|
| 01 | [Two Sum (Problem 1)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Two_Sum) | Understand hashing mechanisms which are crucial for data integrity in security |
| 02 | [Valid Anagram (Problem 242)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Valid_Anagram) | This problem involves checking if two strings are anagrams using hash maps, which can be applied to check data integrity and avoid data tampering |
| 03 | [Count Primes (Problem 204)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Count_Primes) | Understanding how to compute prime numbers efficiently is crucial for algorithms used in cryptography like RSA |
| 04 | [LRU Cache (Problem 146)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/LRU_Cache) | Implementing least recently used (LRU) cache could be relevant for understanding how session management and caching works in web security |
| 05 | [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) (Problem 208)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Implement_Trie) | Tries are useful for auto-completion but can also be used in creating efficient IP routing tables, important for network security |
| 06 | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Problem 3)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Longest_Substring_Without_Repeating_Characters) | Relates to understanding complexity and efficiency in algorithms, crucial for secure and efficient coding practices |
| 07 | [Encode and Decode Strings (Problem 271)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Encode_and_Decode_Strings) | Understanding how to safely encode and decode data can be directly related to data privacy and security measures |
| 08 | [Add and Search Word - Data structure design (Problem 211)](https://github.com/amirasabdu/LeetCode-CyberProgrammer-v1/tree/main/Add_Search_Word_Data_structure_design) | Deals with designing data structures that allow flexible and secure data retrieval, similar to database security mechanisms |
| 09 | Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Problem 153) | While more of an algorithm problem, understanding sorted arrays and searches can aid in understanding more complex encryption and data retrieval algorithms |
| 10 | Linked List Cycle II (Problem 142) | Relevant for understanding memory use and pointers, which can help prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and memory leaks |

These problems provide a good mix of algorithmic complexity and data structure usage, which can help in understanding and solving problems related to secure computing and cybersecurity challenges.
