# Two Sum Solution Explanation

The provided Python code for the twoSum function is an efficient solution that utilizes a hash map (implemented as a dictionary in Python) to track numbers as they are processed along with their indices. Here's a breakdown of how this code works, focusing on its logic and utility:

## Code Breakdown
- Initialize a Dictionary:
	- num\_indices is a dictionary that will store numbers from the list nums as keys, and their indices as values.
- Iterate Over the List:
	- The enumerate function is used to get both the index i and the value num for each element in the list nums.
- Calculate the Complement:
	- For each number num, calculate its complement by subtracting num from the target. This complement is the value that, when added to num, would equal the target.
- Check for the Complement in Dictionary:
	- If the complement is found in the dictionary num\_indices, it means a previous number in the list can be added to the current number num to reach the target. The function then returns a list of the two indices: the index of the complement from the dictionary, and the current index i.
- Update the Dictionary:
	- If the complement is not already in the dictionary, add the current number num and its index i to num\_indices. This step is crucial because it updates the dictionary with each iteration, allowing the solution to consider each element of the list without revisiting them.
- Return an Empty List:
	- If the loop completes without finding any pairs that sum to the target, return an empty list as a default case, indicating no two numbers sum up to the target within the list.
## Key Takeaways
- Efficiency: The use of a dictionary enables checking for the complement in constant time O(1) on average. The overall time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in nums. This is significantly faster than a naive O(n^2) solution using nested loops.
- Single Pass: The solution requires only one pass through the list, making it efficient in terms of both time and operations.
- Space Trade-off: While the time complexity is optimized, this approach uses extra space for the dictionary, which in the worst case might store every element from the list (space complexity O(n)).
###
This approach to solving the twoSum problem is a classic example of using hash maps to increase efficiency by trading off some space. This method is widely applicable beyond just LeetCode problems and can be used in many real-world applications where quick lookups and efficient data handling are necessary.
