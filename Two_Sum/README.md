# Two Sum - Explain in relation to cybersecurity

This twoSum solution uses a dictionary to efficiently find two numbers in a list nums whose sum equals a specified target. While the direct application of this code may not be directly related to cybersecurity, the underlying concept of efficiently finding pairs of values in a dataset can be relevant in security contexts. Here's how this code relates to cybersecurity:

- **Efficient Lookup:** By using a dictionary (num\_indices) to store numbers and their indices, the solution enables fast lookups to check if the complement (target minus the current number) already exists. In cybersecurity, efficient lookup mechanisms are crucial for tasks like searching for patterns in log data or checking for known malicious signatures in network traffic.

- **Preventing Vulnerabilities:** Understanding and efficiently manipulating data structures is essential in cybersecurity to prevent vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or injection attacks. This solution demonstrates an approach to handling data safely and efficiently.

- **Pattern Matching:** The logic used in this code, particularly the use of a dictionary to store and retrieve values, can be applied in cybersecurity for tasks like pattern matching or identifying anomalies in data streams.

- **Optimized Algorithms:** The approach used in this code demonstrates an optimized algorithm for finding pairs of values, which is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity for tasks like identifying potential attack patterns or correlating events across different logs or datasets.

- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the integrity of data and identifying inconsistencies or anomalies is critical in cybersecurity. This code showcases an approach to efficiently process and analyze data, which can be applied to data integrity checks in security systems.
